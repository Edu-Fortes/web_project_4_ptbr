**About**

This is the Sprint 5, 6, 7 and 8 project from Practicum Web Developer Bootcamp. The intent of this project was to recreate the page following a layout designed on Figma, where you can find the link below.

This project is all about a social media like page where the user can share "cards" of places visited inside United States of America (U.S.A).

In this project the HTML, CSS and JavaScript language was used.

The JavaScript part of the project was implemented to create user interaction with the page, like to edit profile section, to add a new place card and to delete it, to give a "like" on a place and finally to validate the forms input. Worth mentioning that no Back-end coding was implemented, therefore when the page is refreshed, the hole page comes back to its original state, the changes are not stored.

The main focus of project 8 was the refactoring of previous projects and applying the object-oriented programming paradigm (OOP), as well as separating files by modules, exporting and importing when necessary.

For project 9, the proposal was to refactor the JS code to use ES6 classes. Each class must perform only one specific task. All the logic related to that specific task must be encapsulated in its respective class. No other specific class is required to accomplish this task. Weak coupling is being used. No instances of other classes are created within a class.

As final requeriment of project 9, the aplication was bundleled using Webpack and Babel.
