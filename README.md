**About**

This is the Sprint 4, 5 and 6 project of Practicum Web Developer Bootcamp. The intent of this project was to recreate the page following pages layout designed on Figma, where you can find the link below.

This project is all about a social media like page where the user can share "cards" of places visited inside United States of America (U.S.A).

In this project the HTML, CSS and JavaScript language was used.

The JavaScript part of the project was implemented to create user interaction with the page, like to edit profile section, to add a new place card and to delete it, to give a "like" on a place and finally to validate the forms input. worth mentioning that no Back-end coding was implemented, therefore when the page is refreshed, the hole page comes back to its original state, the changes are not stored.
