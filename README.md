**About**

This is a project from TripleTen Web Developer Bootcamp. The intent of this project was to recreate the page following a layout designed on Figma, where you can find the link below.

This project is all about a social media like page where the user can share "cards" of places visited inside United States of America (U.S.A).

In this project the HTML, CSS and JavaScript language was used.

The JavaScript part of the project was implemented to create user interaction with the page, like to edit profile section, to add a new place card and to delete it, to give a "like" on a place and finally to validate the forms input. The interaction with the server was made using an API.

Throughout sprints 5 to 10, the page was gradualy been added with features. Starting with a static page thru the one you can check on the link below. Some of the improvements was the refactoring of initial code and applying the object-oriented programming paradigm (OOP), as well as separating files by modules, exporting and importing when necessary.

The final project was accomplished using ES6 classes. Each class must perform only one specific task. All the logic related to that specific task must be encapsulated in its respective class. No other specific class is required to accomplish this task. Weak coupling is being used. No instances of other classes are created within a class.

As final requeriment, the aplication was bundleled using Webpack and Babel.
